# Green Taxi Data Analysis
 Abstract The Taxi Limousine Commission(TLC) provided yellow taxi service for the city of New York. But these taxi services were concentrated to the Manhattan region of the city and did not ride to the outskirts. The green taxi service was hence initiated to cater to the demands outside of Manhattan which started in 2013. The data is vast and there are various conclusions we can draw from it. We aim to maximize the revenue of the company by implementing various machine learning techniques of supervised and unsupervised algorithms to identify the ideal model to the data.
